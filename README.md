## Introduction
This repository is some reading notes and Python implementation for book "Machine Learning for Factor Investing" by Silkdust.

For better compatibility and better accordance with original book, this repository is completed in English. 

The author of this book offers some solutions for Python Notebooks. See detailed info at https://www.mlfactor.com/python.html. However, they did not offer executable files (.ipynb). For your convenience, this project offers both jupyter notebooks (.ipynb) and a PDF version produced by `nbconvert` and XeLaTeX engine.

Finally, I deeply appreciate Guillaume Coqueret and Tony Guida for their devotions to this book. Published in 2020, this book really offers some up-to-date machine learning techniques and their applications to factor investing. They also offer a wide range of literatures in the book for interested readers. As a summary note, this project does not include all literature reviews in the book, and I encourage interested readers explore them in the [references](https://github.com/Silkdust/mlfactor-python/blob/main/REFERENCES.md) section or in the original book.

Hope you have fun reading this project!

## Depedencies
Dependencies packages will be released in the repository in future versions in `requirenments.txt`. Generally speaking, you have to install Python3 (version 3.8 or later preferred) and jupyter notebook in your device at first. To get your notebooks work properly in your device, run the following command at the beginning:
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

For better I/O speed, the `data_ml` object is stored in `.pkl` format. However, this costs a lot of storage space and is *not* pushed to the repo. You may run the following commands to generate it under the `/data/` folder:
```
import pandas as pd
import pyreadr
# data = pd.read_excel("./data/data_ml.xlsx") # Not Recommended. Too Slow!
result = pyreadr.read_r('./data/data_ml.RData')
data = result['data_ml']
data.to_pickle("./data/data_ml.pkl")
```
